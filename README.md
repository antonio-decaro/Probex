# ProbeX

Nowadays space exploration is limited by technology and physics. Imagine finding yourself in a future where space travel is much easier. The goal of this project is to exploit serverless computing in order to find potentially habitable planets. A telescope will be in charge of spotting planets with characteristics similar to those of the earth, meanwhile a probe will be sent on that planet to obtain more accurate informations.
