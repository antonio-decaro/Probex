Nowadays space exploration is limited by technology and physics. Imagine finding yourself in a future where space travel is much easier. The goal of this project is to exploit serverless computing in order to find potentially habitable planets. A telescope will be in charge of spotting planets with characteristics similar to those of the earth, meanwhile a probe will be sent on that planet to obtain more accurate informations.

# Introduction

This project has been realized for the Serverless Computing for IoT class at "Universit√† degli Studi di Salerno".

ProbeX takes place in a future in which interstellar travels are possible. The goal of the project is to discover potentially habitable planets exploiting the Serverless computing.

In the following sections will be explained how to achive the goal, which are the main technologies involved in this project and will be discussed all the solution design decisions.
